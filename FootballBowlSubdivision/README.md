# JPACRUDProject


## Overview
This program is a basic web-based app that allows a user to access and modify and database of FBS Teams. The program utilizes JPA and Spring Boot MVC to implement CRUD functionality. On the home page of the web app, the user is displayed with options to list all teams, add a new team, lookup a team or school by Id, update a teams details, and lastly the ability to delete teams from the database. If an option is chosen, the user is taken to it's specific form for completion. Once the form complete, the user can submit the modifications and are then taken to a landing page that confirms the intended action is complete.

## Lessons Learned
Throughout the creation of this program, the biggest challenge was mentally mapping out the flow of each CRUD operation, and which JSP pages are needed for each. The next hurdle I was able to get past was ensuring that each variable was mapped correctly to avoid errors.
